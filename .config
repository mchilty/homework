Q: What are some differences between a VM and a Container?
A: some differences...

VM:
-runs entire OS within virtualized hardware environment, managed by the virtualized kernel and Hypervisor
-system restore points provided by system backup/snapshot which is often external/sidecar (i.e. non-native)
-provides users with full OS environment for development work if needed and when required by software/vendor
-can consolidate many functions into one system instance (web server, DB)
-allows for "lift and shift" virtualization of non-virtualized system for migration to cloud or other non-bare-iron envs


Container:
-relies on host OS for memory, CPU, direct hardware, all managed by the host kernel
-may run a single service and required libraries but could also be an "entire OS" worth of packages/libraries (discrete instance of an app/process as a microservice)
-immutable images provide clean "restore" points, IAC means rebuilding with config/docker compose is consistent and uses platform-native functionality
-typically purpose-built so that "unnecessary services" are never brought to life
-very portable and more scalable than VMs
